# quest

Tiny, time-boxed practical quests for real DevOps skills.
One folder per quest. No copy-paste solutions; each quest has a clear DoD.

## Struture
- `Q1-DotenvGuard` → the quest folder (spec + later code)
- More quests: add more folders at the repo root

## How to use
1) Write/adjust the spec (`SPEC_IO.md`) first.
2) Implement minimal features to sastify the DoD.
3) Commit with Conventional Commits (e.g., `docs(spec):...`, `feat:...`).

## DoD (Definition of Done)
- Clear input/output + one sample case
- Runs locally and prints expected result
- Exit codes follow the spec
- At least one commit and a short log line
